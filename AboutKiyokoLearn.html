<h2 style="border-bottom:3px dashed gray;">No Homework!!!</h2>
<p>
...Well, not really. As much as everybody hates homework, it does serve a purpose. You may understand everything that is going on in class, but until you actually get your hands dirty, you will never learn anything. However, here at Kiyoko Learn, we don't have homework. We have projects. Projects are a way for you to practice what you are learning. However, there are no due dates or grades for projects.

<h2 style="border-bottom:3px dashed gray;">Who is Kiyoko?</h2>
<img src="Kiyoko.jpg" align="left">
<p>
I'm just a simple college student who is fed up with all the hoops that college makes me jump through. 
Nobody deserves to go through this. 
I created Kiyoko Learn so others could learn anything that one would in a normal college class without actually being in/paying for a college class. 
Another reason I created this is because several times I would hear classmates say that the professor was moving too fast, 
while another student in the same class would complain that the professor was moving too slow, that they were bored. 
When people approach school, everbody has a different background and learns at a different pace 
so this was designed to help people learn at their own pace.
</p>

<p>
I'm not about to put all my personal information out on the web.
I work in Security on campus. I've seen what hackers can do with just a little bit of info.
However, I will say that although I am an Honors student and I graduated 9th in my high school class, I am no genius.
I worked for hard for the grades that I got, and sometimes my grades didn't always reflect how hard I worked.
The reason I have suceeded is because I never give up and I work hard to make things work.
My grandparents and my father have all passed away. I haven't had the greatest life, but I know that I am still quite fortunate.
I appreciate what I have been given and have worked hard to earn everything else I have gained.
If you truly intend to learn something from Kiyoko Learn, you have to put real effort into it.
yet, the benefits are truly worth the effort.
</p>

<p>
Now, I'm going to contradict myself. If there is one think I've learned from losing my father and grandparents is to not work too hard.
Life is short, shorter than most of us expect. Work hard to learn what you need and get a good job, 
but don't put so much work into your job that by the time you get where you want to be, half of your life has gone by.
</p>

<p>
I'm not a preacher telling you how to live your lives. I'm simply sharing the information I've learned from college and life.
I hope you can put it to good use.
