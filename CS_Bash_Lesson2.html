To begin using command line, you must first open up the terminal. 
If you are unsure how to do that, you can visit the tutorial under the Resources Page

<h3>The Prompt and ls</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr><td>
Once you are in the terminal, you will see the prompt, which looks something like this:
<br />
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName:~$</strong></div>
<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now, you are in your Username directory. 
When using a GUI, you would see a little window, 
typically with a bunch of pictures of folders labeled desktop, documents, pictures, etc.
So, if I'm in my directory, why don't I see all those folders?
If you type in "ls" (which stands for list), it will print on the screen everything that is in that directory.

<br />
<br />
<br />

<!-- Insert picture of terminal -->
<!-- Insert picture of folder when you are in "home" -->

After the command prompt, simply type ls:<br />
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName:~$ ls</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

Then press enter. It should look something like this:<br /><br />
<strong>
<table cellpadding="5">
	<tr>
		<td>backup</td>
		<td>documents</td>
		<td>images</td>
		<td>videos</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>bin</td>
		<td>desktop</td>
		<td>templates</td>
		<td>downloads</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>music</td>
		<td>tmp</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</strong>

<br />
<br />
<br />

It is ok, if you have more or less folders than the ones I listed above.
</td></tr></table>

<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>Changing Directories</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr><td>
But what if I want to go into one of those folders? 
When using a normal GUI, you would simply double click on the folder
(or single click depending on your settings). 
In the terminal, you have to use the command "cd" (change directory).
You would type "cd" and then the name of the folder you want to go into.

<br />
<br />

For example, to go into the documents folder type:<br />
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName:~$ cd documents/</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

<em>Helpful Hint:</em> <br />
if you start typing a file or folder or even a command and then press tab,
the terminal will try to autocomplete. For example, if I type:<br />
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName~$ cd doc</strong></div> <br />
and then press tab, it will automatically change to: <br />
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName~$ cd documents/</strong></div> <br />
If I only type: <br />
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName~$ cd d</strong></div> <br />
and then press tab, it will only change to: <br />
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName~$ cd do</strong></div> <br />
because I could be refering to documents or downloads.
It doesn't know which one to auto-complete to. 
I would have to add either a "w" or "c" and then press tab for it to finish auto-completing.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

When you press enter, your prompt will change to:</br >
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName:~/documents$</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

The change in the prompt shows that we are now in the documents directory.
If we want to see what we have in this folder, you can use the ls command again.</br >
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName:~/documents$ ls</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

In my documents folder, I have files and folders, most of which are school related. <br />
<div><strong>
Essay.txt &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Kiyoko_Learn &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Me.jpg &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

Depending on your settings, these may be color coded. 
On my particular terminal, the image (Me.jpg) is purple, 
the folder (Kiyoko Learn) is blue,
and the text file (Essay.txt) is white.

<br />
<br />

Now, what if I don't want to be in the documents folder anymore?
What if I want to go back to the home folder?
What if I want to hit the "back botton" per say?
To do this, use the "cd .." command. 
Literally this means change the working directory to the one above the current directory.

<br />
<br />

For example, if I use type in the "cd .." command:<br />
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName:~/documents$ cd ..</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

When I press enter, my promt changes back to:<br />
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName:~$</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

Now I've been changing directories a lot and I've gotten really far from my Username directory.
I don't feel like typing "cd .." over and over again until I get back to where I started.
Is there a shortcut for this? Of course there is! use the command "cd ~". The ~ stands for your Username. <br />
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName:~/Folder1/Folder2/Folder3$ cd ~</strong></div>
</td></tr></table>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>New Directories</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr><td>
So, I like the directories I have and all, but what if I want to make a new one?
The command "mkdir" stands for make directory. 
You would type "mkdir" and then the name of the directory.

<br />
<br />

For example, if I wanted to make a new directory called Practice:<br />
<div><strong>Username@ComputerName:~$ mkdir Practice</strong></div>

<br />
<br />

When you press enter, your prompt will simply appear again
and I'm sure your first response will be, "What just happened? Was my directory made or not?"
Rest assured, there is nothing to fear. If you type in "ls" again, your directory should be there.

<br />
<br />

<div><strong>
Username@ComputerName:~$ ls</div><br /><div>
Essay.txt &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Kiyoko_Learn &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Me.jpg &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Practice &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
</strong></div>
</td></tr></table>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>Print Working Directory</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr><td>
So I've been moving around directories a lot, and now I'm really confused where I am.
If you look at the prompt, that should give you and idea of where you are.
But what if I want to know the full pathname?
Use the "pwd" command which stands for print working directory.

For example, if I am in the new folder Practice that we just created and I wanted to see the full pathname:
<div><strong>
Username@ComputerName:~/Practice$ pwd</div><br /><div>
/home/Username/Practice
</strong></div>
</td></tr></table>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>Other details you don't care for:</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr><td>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
	<tr>
		<td><strong>$ ls -a</strong></td>
		<td>"List all" - View hidden files. Hidden files will be denoted with a "." before them</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>$ ls -l</strong></td>
		<td>"Long list" - Lists name of file, when it was last modified, and its size in bytes.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</td></tr></table>
