<h2>Lesson 3 -- Files</h2>

<em>
Note:<br />
In the previous tutorial, 
when showing what commands to type into the terminal,
I wrote out </em><strong>Username@ComputerName~$</strong><em> 
but I get tired fo typing that whole thing out over and over again.
From now on when I am showing you commands to type in, I will simply use $.
I am doing this because the prompt changes depending on what directory you are in, etc.
Just know that when I use $, I am implying that there is a prompt before the $.

<h3>Echo</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr><td>
The previous tutorial was about just navigating through files, 
but what if I want to interact with the shell more?
Well, the first command we'll talk about is echo. 
The echo command basically tells the shell to "echo" back whatever you tell it to.

<br />
<br />

For example, if I want the computer to say to me "Hello World":<br />
<div><strong>$ echo "Hello World"</strong><div/>

<br />
<br />
<br />

Then press enter and it will spit out:<br />
<div><strong>Hello World</strong></div>
</td></tr></table>

<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>More Than One Command</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr><td>
What if we want the shell to do multiple things at once,
instead of us having to type in each individual command and hit enter?
You can use the ";" to separate commands.

For example, I want to the computer to spit out "Hello World" and "Hello Kiyoko":<br />
<div><strong>$ echo "Hello World";echo "Hello Kiyoko"</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

When you press enter, the terminal prints out:
<div><strong>Hello World<br />HelloKiyoko</strong></div>
</td></tr></table>

<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>New Line with Echo</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr><td>
But what if I'm the perfectionist who doesn't want "Hello World" and "Hello Kiyoko" on two different lines?
What if I want them on the same line? To do this, we would use -n with echo.
The -n is telling Bash to not use a new line after that command

<br />
<br />

For Example:<br />
<div><strong>$ echo -n "Hello World";echo "Hello Kiyoko:</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

When you press enter:<br />
<div><strong>Hello WorldHello Kiyoko</strong></div>
</td></tr></table>

<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>Saving to a File</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr><td>
So, you can now print to the screen. That's cool.
But let's say my laptop just died.
When I open the terminal again, everything I printed to the screen is gone!
Does that mean everything I printed to the screen earlier is gone?
Do I have to retype EVERYTHING?!

Well, there are two fixes for this.
The first is that by using the up arrow, you can recall previously entered commands.
The second is that, when using the echo command, instead of having it print to the screen,
you can have it save to a file. To do this, you will use >> but we will come back to this.
However, I first want to mention that you can create a file using the touch command. <br />
<div><strong>$ touch filename1</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

now, if you were to type in ls, the file filename1 would be listed, even though the file is empty
But I don't want that file to be empty. As mentioned before, I'm going to use the echo command with >><br />
<div><strong>$ echo "Hello World" >> filename1</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

This is telling Bash to take the input and instead of outputting the result to the screen,
output the info to a file.

<br />
<br />

But what if I forgot to use the touch command first! what if I typed in:
<div><strong>$ echo "Hello World" >> filename2</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

Don't freak out. If filename2 didn't already exist when you executed that command,
It simply creates the file filename2.
</td></tr></table>

<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>Removing Files</h3>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tr><td>
But, but, but.... what if I created a file and didn't mean to? How do I get rid of it?
You can remove files using the rm command.<br />
<div><strong>$ rm filename2</strong></div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

Keep in mind that, unlike other systems, 
Bash does not prompt you to make sure you really want to delete that file.
Once you delete that file, its gone for good. 
Also know that rm is only for deleting files.
It does not work for directories.

<h2>Practice</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		Print to the screen: <br />
		<strong>"Hello World, my name is Kiyoko." </br >
		"What is your name?"</strong> </br >
		Using the following segments:
		<ul>
			<li>"Hello World, "</li>
			<li>"my name is "</li>
			<li>"Kiyoko."</li>
			<li>"What is "</li>
			<li>"your name?"</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<br />
<br />

<h2>Practice Answers</h2>
<ol>
	<li>echo -n "Hello World, "; echo -n "my name is "; echo "Kiyoko."; echo -n "What is "; echo "your name?"</li>
</ol>
