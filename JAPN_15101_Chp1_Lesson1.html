<h2>Lesson 1 -- The Writing System</h2>

<br />

<table width="90%" align="center"><tr><td>

In Japanese there are three different writing systems, Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. 
All three could be found in one sentence.

<ul>
	<li> 
		Hiragana is for particals and verb conjugations, which will be discussed in greater detail in later lessons.
		For now, most vocabulary words will be written in Hiragana.
	</li>

	<li>
		Katakana is used for foreign words
	</li>

	<li>
		Kanji is mostly used for nouns, adjectives, and the stems of verbs.
	</li>
</ul>

<br />

Unlike the English alphabet which consists of consonants and vowels, the Japanese alphabet consists of syllables.<br />
For Example:
<ul>
	<li>English: a, b, c, d, e</li>
	<li>Japanese: ka, ki, ku, ke, ko</li>
</ul>

<br />

There are 46 main Hiragana symbols and they are considered to have a "roundish" shape. 
Adding things like tenten and maru, which will be discussed in later lessons, create more sounds.
Contracted sounds can also be made. 

<br />
<br />

Similarily, there are 46 main Katakana symbols, but they are considered to have more "straight" lines.
Tenten and maru can also be added to Katakana as well as contracted sounds.

<br />
<br />

Kanji comes from the Chinese characters and were introduced in Japan before Japan had a writing system. 
Hiragana and Katakana are considered to be simplified Chinese characters.
Kanji characters are a little more complex than Hiragana and Katakana. 
They can represent meanings and sounds, and there are two readings for them.
The <em>on-yomi</em>, or Chinese readings, come from the Chinese pronunciation and may have more than one reading.
The <em>kun-yomi</em>, or Japanese readings, were used to write native Japanese words. <br />
There are four basic types of Kanji:
<ul>
	<li>Picture Based</li>
	<li>Simple Ideograms</li>
	<li>Compound Ideograms</li>
	<li>Phonetic Ideographic Characters</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />

Note 1:<br />
When writing Japanese, there typically aren't any spaces between the words.

<br />
<br />
<br />

Note 2:<br />
The computer font for the writing systems sometimes differs from how the characters would be when they are written by hand.<br />

When the characters are first introduced in the coming lessons, 
if there is a difference between the way it is written and the way it is printed, images of both will be shown.
